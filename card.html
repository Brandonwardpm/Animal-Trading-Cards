			<p class="italics">Bitcoin meets the qualifications of an organism in that it has an organized structure, can react to stimuli, reproduce, grow, adapt, and maintain homeostatis independently.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: The Bitcoin Blockchain</li>
				<li><span>Hash Rate</span>: 239 EH/s</li>

			<p class="orangepill">Censorship-resistant, digital, sound money whose purchasing power cannot be confiscated by neither force nor inflation. Bitcoin is not a currency, but rather the purest form of property mankind has ever invented. As such, barring any unlikely and catastrophic circumstances, Bitcoin will ultimately become the global reserve asset under which humanity unifies, liberating us all from the pitfalls of our biological and sociological shortcomings.</p>
