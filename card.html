			<p>Censorship-resistant, digital, sound money whose purchasing power cannot be confiscated by neither force nor inflation. Bitcoin is not a currency, but rather the purest form of property mankind has ever invented. As such, barring any unlikely and catastrophic circumstances, Bitcoin will ultimately become the global reserve asset under which humanity unifies, liberating us from the pitfalls of our societal shortcomings.</p>
